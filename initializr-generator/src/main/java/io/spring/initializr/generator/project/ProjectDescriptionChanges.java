/**
 * Records the changes that have been applied to a {@link ProjectDescription} and the
 * reason why they were applied.
 * <p>
 * A {@link ProjectDescriptionCustomizer} that modifies a field should record a reason for
 * doing so, so that the reason can be reported to the user rather than inferred from a
 * {@link ProjectDescriptionDiff}. A reason must only be recorded if the field is actually
 * changed, and should be a self-contained sentence as it is reported as-is. Any markup
 * that a reason uses has to match what the component reporting it expects, see the
 * reference documentation.
 * <p>
 * At most one reason is kept per field: if several customizers change the same field,
 * only the reason of the last one is kept as it supersedes the previous ones.
 * Consequently, a reason should describe the value that has been set and why, but not the
 * value that has been replaced, as the latter may well be an intermediate value that no
 * other component has seen.
 * <p>
 * Each {@link MutableProjectDescription} has its own instance, see
 * {@link MutableProjectDescription#getChanges()}. Customizers are typically shared by
 * concurrent project generations, so they must record against the description they are
 * given rather than hold on to an instance of this class.
